# The University of Derby Presentation

# Overview

As per the brief this application is an image gallery.

Combining the brief and parts of the job description I came up with idea of a student's timeline at the University of Derby, from Day 1 through to graduation. This was the initial idea, but it can be expanded to many area's of onboarding students. For example, with the new business school due to open in the heart of the city centre next year in Spring, this application could be modified to specifically target that audience and provide them with short form content about the journey in this subject. And, if they wish, leading them to longer form content and more in depth information.

# Additional

- Testing: The application includes unit testing and using React Testing Library and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Evolution: The project is set up to expand and be able to add more features such as specific journeys for specific courses.
- Accessibility/Performance: The project scores highly in accessibility using the lighthouse tool in Google dev tools. The application does need some work on performance, mainly due to the size of the image files. This is something I will look into changing the jpg files to WebP or AVIF.
- Key Takeaways: For me, my biggest takeaway is SCSS instead of CSS, this is the first project I have done the styling in this way and I really enjoyed it. Not only that, I can see the benefit of SCSS in a large scale application, not repeating code and it seems very scalable. I have just started with this but I am keen to learn more.
